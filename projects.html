The project was concerned with the problem of neural causal discovery, i.e. uncovering causal relationships from data using deep learning techniques. We proposed a novel method of score-based causal discovery using continuous data, and we showed how adversarially training a neural causal model can, under suitable assumptions, uncover the causal structure underlying a dataset of up to 10 variables.</p> <br /> <p> <b><a href="papers/learning-neural-causal-models-with-adversarial-training.pdf" target="blank">Paper</a></b> <span class="separator"></span> <b><a href="https://github.com/augustwester/adversarial-ncm" target="blank">Code</a></b> </p> </div> </div> <div class="project-container"> <div class="project-image-container"> <img src="assets/images/vdcvae.png"> </div> <div class="project-text-container"> <h2>Very Deep Conditional Variational Autoencoders</h2> <br /> <p>This project built upon <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10650'>work at OpenAI</a> on "very deep" variational autoencoders. We explored how the architecture used in the paper could be extended to become conditional, i.e. to enable more fine-grained control of the model's outputs. The effort was motivated by a desire to improve adversarial robustness in the architecture proposed in our Bachelor's thesis.</p> <br /> <p> <b><a href="papers/very-deep-conditional-variational-autoencoders.pdf" target="blank">Paper</a></b> <span class="separator"></span> <b><a href="https://github.com/augustwester/vdcvae" target="blank">Code</a></b> </p> </div> </div> <div class="project-container"> <div class="project-image-container"> <img src="assets/images/augmenting.png"> </div> <div class="project-text-container"> <h2>Augmenting Robustness Using Adversarial Detection</h2> <br /> <p>My Bachelor's thesis. The project was concerned with the problem of improving adversarial robustness in neural network-based image recognition models. Concretely, we proposed a novel architecture making use of a conditional variational autoencoder to preprocess image inputs followed by a detection mechanism aimed at identifying and discarding adversarial examples.</p> <br /> <p> <b><a href="papers/augmenting-robustness-using-adversarial-detection.pdf" target="blank">Paper</a></b> <span class="separator"></span> <b><a href="https://github.com/augustwester/augmenting" target="blank">Code</a></b> </p> </div> </div> <div class="project-container"> <div class="project-image-container"> <img src="assets/images/deepdream.png"> </div> <div class="project-text-container"> <h2>DeepDream</h2> <br /> <p>I made a PyTorch implementation of the DeepDream algorithm proposed in 2015 by Alex Mordvintsev. The code makes it easy to transform existing images into surreal versions of themselves or to create new "dreams" from noise alone (examples are shown on the right). I also wrote an associated blog post describing the algorithm with the help of interactive visualizations.</p> <br /> <p> <b><a href="https://sigmoidprime.com/post/deepdream/" target="blank">Post</a></b> <span class="separator"></span> <b><a href="https://github.com/augustwester/deepdream" target="blank">Code</a></b> </p> </div> </div> <div class="project-container"> <div class="project-image-container"> <img src="assets/images/sigmoidprime.png"> </div> <div class="project-text-container"> <h2>Sigmoid Prime</h2> <br /> <p>I started a blog in late 2016 focused on explaining topics in machine learning in an accessible and beginner-friendly way. The project was motivated by the Feynman technique, namely that the best way to learn is to teach. I was also inspired by the <a href='https://distill.pub/' target='blank'>Distill journal</a> to emphasize visualization and animation. Since this makes creating posts more time-consuming than I'd like, it's been quite over there for a while now.</p> <br /> <p> <b><a href="https://sigmoidprime.com/" target="blank">Sigmoidprime.com</a></b> </p> </div> </div> <div class="project-container"> <div class="project-image-container"> <img src="assets/images/tones.png"> </div> <div class="project-text-container"> <h2>Tones</h2> <br /> <p>Inspired by the playback statistics on <a href='https://last.fm/'>Last.fm</a>, I built a music app for iOS in 2014. Besides acting as a music player for the phone's on-device library (this was before streaming services caught on), it focused on displaying playback statistics using metadata from the iTunes library. The app is no longer hosted on the App Store, but it was a fun project and a good exercise in Objective-C and mobile UI design.</p> <br /> <p> </p> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
